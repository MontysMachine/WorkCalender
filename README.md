This application allows you to store your events of the day to keep you on track. to start simply enter the details of the event in the appropriate text box next to the time of the event. Then click the blue button on the right side of the page to save the event. by doing so you are logging those event details and the hour of the event into local storage. this allows the page to be refreshed without resetting the schedule so that the user can still view their events of the day.
